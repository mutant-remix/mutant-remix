This repository contains all of the files required to build a custom Mutant Remix package using Orxporter.

Mutant Remix is not affiliated with [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech/). This is a transformation of the original Mutant Standard emoji pack, created by nizune for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat/).

## Download

## Building
> This guide assumes general familiarity with git and the command line. If you are not familiar with these, you should [join the communities](#communities) listed above and ask for help.

To build Mutant Remix, clone this repository recursively.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mutant-remix/mutant-remix
```

> If you did not clone recursively, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodules.

### Dependencies
This repository has no warranty and has only been tested with Arch Linux. If you are using a different distribution (or Windows), check out the [non-arch](#non-arch) section.

You will need:
- [Orxporter prerequisites](https://github.com/mutant-remix/orxporter#prerequisites)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + `yarn`
- `wget`

```bash
# Install base packages
sudo pacman -Syu --needed \
    wget \
    python python-pip \ # for running orxporter
    nodejs yarn \ # for running coverage-calculator
    rustup \ # for installing resvg
    oxipng perl-image-exiftool svgcleaner libwebp # orxporter dependencies

# You may experience issues if you use resvg from the AUR
# It is recommended to use cargo
rustup install stable # install rust/cargo
cargo install resvg # orxporter dependency

# Install orxporter and forc dependencies
pip install -r ./orxporter/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./forc/requirements.txt

# Install coverage-calculator dependencies
cd coverage-calculator
yarn install

cd ..
```

### Non-arch
**If you are not running Arch Linux** (Windows or another distribution), here are the alternatives:

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
You can use WSL to run the build scripts in an Arch Linux container. This works on **Windows 10** and **Windows 11**.

- [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- If you choose to use Ubuntu, install the dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu as listed in the [manual](#manual) section

#### Docker
You can use Docker to run the build scripts in an Arch Linux container. This works on **Windows** and **Linux**.

```bash
cd mutant-remix
docker run -it --rm -v ./:/mutant-remix docker.io/archlinux:latest /bin/bash
cd /mutant-remix
```

> You can use Podman instead of Docker. The command is the same, just `podman` instead of `docker`.

Then follow the [dependencies](#dependencies) section.

#### Manual
If you do not want to use an Arch Linux container, or are running **Mac OS** you can install the dependencies manually.

Package names may vary depending on your distribution and alternatives will only be provided for Debian/Ubuntu and Mac OS.

Arch Linux package | Debian/Ubuntu | Mac OS
--- | --- | ---
`wget` | `apt install wget` | `brew install wget`
`libwebp` | `apt install webp` | `brew install webp`
`perl-image-exiftool` | `apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` | `brew install exiftool`
`libpng-dev` | `apt install libpng-dev` | `brew install libpng`
`python python-pip` | `apt install python3 python-pip` | `brew install python`
`nodejs` | [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) + `nvm install node` | `brew install node`
`yarn` | `npm install -g yarn` | `brew install yarn`
`rustup` | [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) | `brew install rustup`
`svgcleaner` | `cargo install svgcleaner` | `cargo install svgcleaner`
`oxipng` | `cargo install oxipng` | `cargo install oxipng`

> You may experience issues if you use `svgcleaner` and `resvg` from your distribution's repositories. It is recommended to use the `cargo` versions.

Then follow the [dependencies](#dependencies) section, skipping the `pacman` step.

### Basic usage
The first-time build is going to take 3-15 minutes (depending on your CPU). Subsequent builds will be several times faster, as only the changed files will be rebuilt.
```bash
sh out_final_full.sh
```

If everything worked, you will find the built pack in `./out/final-pkg`

Note that **you do not need to build the full pack every time**. A script more suited for development is `./out_test_svg.sh`, which is much faster.
```bash
sh out_test_svg.sh
```

### Other scritps
```bash
sh out_coverage.sh
sh out_test_png.sh
sh out_final_basic.sh
sh out_web_content_json.sh
sh out_web_content.sh
```
